#Magic Sorter
**Where is the code
The magic code is stored in magic_sorter.js, just one line!

**How to use
Just copy that line of code into the browser console then hit Enter!

**Difference between sorter.js
1. To keep the original lookings of the table, background color of a row will not be changed.
2. Local CSS file can not be adapted to the other web page, so some CSS styling will not work.

**Sortable site
It is difficult to find a website using jquery as well as lodash:( But try this!
